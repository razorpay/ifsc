### Added

-   Regular Metadata Changes. See [Release Page][1.4.0] for a list.
-   One new Bank: `AJAR`
-   Adds NPCI-only IFSCs from https://www.npci.org.in/national-automated-clearing-live-members-1. See #100 and #109 for some more details.
-   A `NEFT=true|false` flag is added on all datasets, which will get added to the API with this release.
-   A `IMPS=true|false` flag is added, which is currently in alpha. There is not enough clarity around this yet (See #109), so please don't use this in production yet. This can be removed at any time. Feedback on the correctness of this flag is welcome.
-   A MICR is now available for all rows. This will also reflect on the API.

### Changed

-   Parser speed and general improvements. Builds only take 3 minutes, and caching related stuff is removed.
-   The parser converts XLS/XLSX files to CSV before parsing, which results in cleaner data in some cases.

### Removed

-   Removes some data formats (YAML/Large JSON) for cleaner code. If you were using them, please let create an issue.
